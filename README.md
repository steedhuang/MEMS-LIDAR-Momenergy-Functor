# MEMS-LIDAR-Momenergy-Functor
This project is to demonstrate the use of a new concept called
Momenergy (A fractional moment in between 1st order Momentum 
and 2nd order energy) to do the identification of the object 
in real time fashion.
 
For simplicity, the input file is in the plain text format, 
so is the output file.  

The same calculation is done in C code, and Excel spreadsheet
as well to help on the understanding of the concept.

By momentum generating function theory, any fractional moment
contains the linear combination of infinite order moments, 
by highly parallel construction of a neuron network 
interconnecting the momenergy layer, as if we have 
an infinite deep network.
